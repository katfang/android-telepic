* Sec: add users?
* Sec: make each turn immutable?
* Don't join games you've already contributed to
* Rename join to play?
* List: order by last update?
* Layout: make white background default
* Image: make as strokes?
* DrawingView: @TODO Sets w, h to 1 if it is 0 to fix the fact it needs to be > 0 and not null.

* There no way to get the name from the model?
* Join: Lock if someone is adding: tx to make priority -1




security: 
  can view any game
  cannot 
  can write (not edit) any game /game/#/state/#

If:
{
    "rules": {
        "games": {
          ".read": true,
          "$other": {
	          ".write": true
	      }
        }
    }
}
Then can't read turns

Feedback:
* being able to update from the model!
  Ended up storing the model name grabbed from datasnapshot
  maybe should have stored the datasnapshot?
* Setting the value seems to oblierate the priority :(
* Doc page for Java Simple Login -- code suggests createUser also logs user in. But the line below says it doesn't.

* Security rules to only push new data, not edit old data
